Like many people, Johannes is also a big fan of the video game, especially the real-time strategy game. Johannes especillay loves playing starcraft I/II, warcraft III, Command &amp; Conquer 2, 3, 4, etc. Though Johannes loves these games, Johannes does not want to become a professional in them. Because rules of these games change frequently and it is very difficult to maintain the balance of power among different races in the game. To be a good game player is as difficult as to be a good musician or a good scientist. Johannes has no energy to achieve success in such fields. However, Johannes find it's great to do many interesting things on games. Such as developing computer games, studying the Countermeasure  algorithm, developing game assistant programs, etc. Recently, Johannes is keen on implementing the state-of-art autonomous driving algorithms on the prevalent race video game - Kartrider. The codes of this study will be open source soon.
