= Hyper Computation Center


â€œLife is limited, ReDevOps(Research & Development & Operation) makes it infinity."  --- Johannes Liu

== Introduction
Hyper Computation Center(HCC) is an specific implementation of the experimental management module, which is contained in the theory of ReDevOps, proposed by Johannes. ReDevOps can be regarded as a deviation version of DevOps, which is specific for the research activities. Different from the traditional theory of devops, ReDevOps focuses more on how to combine research, development, and operation and maintenance to help do research efficiently. The ultimate purpose of ReDevOps is to help end the meaningless labor for scientific research. The ReDevOps can be regarded to the Gitbook[https://github.com/JohannesLiu/ReDevOps Link], written by Johannes. Johannes is about to finish this book in the year of 2023, as a gift for his Ph.D. career.

== The history of Hyper Computation Center

=== Third Generation of HCC (2023 - Present)
==== Introduction

The second generation of Johannes's lab makes the working environment mobile. Johannes can easily put his environment into his bag. However, the second generation of Johannes's Lab has the following flaws:
1. Lack of Quick Deployment of Scientific Tools.
2. Strong Coupling between components in a lab.
3. Lack of Unified Resource Management Platform.

Awarded of these requirements, Johannes reconstructed his secondary generation lab to the new construction. Due to the fact that the third generation Johannes' laboratory has even oversteps the enterprise level standards, Johannes named his laboratory Hyper Computing Center. Johannes hopes more and more research could leverages his infrastructures for the efficient experiments.


=== Second Generation of HCC (2022 - 2023)
==== Introduction
Since Johannes left Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Johannes lost his convenient work environment. Johannes cannot leverage his infrastructures to for his work. The only thing he can relied is his old friend, the mobile thinkpad workstation, which cannot help Johannes face the quickly changing working environment. To help improve his work, quickly carrying out experiments, and be an independent research. It costs Johannes 1 month to reconstruct his second generation lab.

Compared with the first generation lab, the second generation lab enables,
1. Distributed computation environment management.
2. Higher levels of virtualization.
3. Flexible expansion of computation nodes.
4. Mobile scientific workspace.
5. Enterprise Management Mode.

=== First Generation of HCC(2019-2022)

==== Main Equipments in Lab
Johannes's self raised and self built laboratory (2019-2022) with equipment above 2500$ includes:
